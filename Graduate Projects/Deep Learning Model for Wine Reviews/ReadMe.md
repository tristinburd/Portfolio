__Project Goal__

The goal of this project was to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of deep learning, to predict various wine attributes based on sommelier descriptions. In the world of wine, sommeliers and wine connoisseurs use a broad vocabulary to describe the types of flavors, aromas, and overall profiles of wines. By developing a deep learning model capable of understanding and predicting wine descriptions, I can offer valuable insights to stakeholders within the wine industry. For instance, new wine enthusiasts could use this model to understand a wine's characteristics, simply from its description. Additionally, retailers could also leverage this model to assess the quality of new wines they're considering for their store lineup.


__Source Data__

The data used for this project was retrieved from Kaggle, a widely recognized public data repository. The dataset contained two separate files, version 1 with 150,000 rows of data and version 2 with 130,000 rows of data.
