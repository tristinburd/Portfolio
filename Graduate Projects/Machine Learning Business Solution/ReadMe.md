__Project Overview__

Convenient Food Mart (CFM) is a nationwide chain of convenience stores in the United States, established with the mission of offering a mini grocery store experience in accessible neighborhood locations. With the advent of digital technology and e-commerce, CFM's management is facing challenges. The team believes that a deeper understanding of customer behavior and precise calculation of customer acquisition costs from marketing campaigns could enhance the company's profitability. To address this, they have enlisted the expertise of Tristin, a data consultant from AI and Data Sciences, to devise a solution. This solution is expected to empower the management team to make data-driven decisions on marketing expenditure and resource distribution.


__Business Problem Identification__

To assist CFM's management team, Tristin is tasked with developing a comprehensive data solution in two key areas. First, he must apply data analytics to determine primary consumer segments of CFM, describing distinct traits and characteristics of each group. This will be accomplished through the application of k-means clustering for segmentation. Subsequently, Tristin will need to provide a predictive model that estimates the customer acquisition cost from conditional inputs.
